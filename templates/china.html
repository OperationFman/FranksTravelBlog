            Federation University gave me the life changing opportunity to travel

            (Web development actually) with a Chinese University.

        <h1>Study Abroad in Shaoguan</h1><br>
        <p> We arrived at ChristChurch on the southern island, tired and sore.
          But soon we’d be in our hire car and headed for Tekapo, unless of
          course something unforeseen stopped us.
          <br><br>
          Yep, I made the booking with rentalcars.com making sure the company we
          originally booked with allowed for under 25 year olds. Yet when they changed
          our booking to a different company they elected to omit that special request
          even when I asked them to make sure.
          <br>
          We did receive a partial refund since it was their fault (and I had proof) but
          it was a headache I hoped to avoid.
          <br><br>
          Luckily we got a new hire with a new company and journeys off to the west
          just fine (After trying the local cuisine, Maccas (Or as they call it in kiwi
          land, McDonalds).

            After a rather dangerous drive (We were pretty tired) we made it to the
            stunningly blue lake of Tekapo, known best for the old Shepherd's Cottage
            sitting by the banks with it’s vivid purple flowers spoked everywhere. <br>
            It’s said it’s impossible to take a bad photo of this monument and I believe
            it.
            <br><br>
            We spent the night skipping rocks on the lake and giggling like schoolgirls at
            baby ducks.

          The next day was predominantly spent driving. <br>
          We first visited the top of a mountain nearby tekapo for a hot breakfast then
          drove through valleys and mountains on our way to the famous Queenstown.
          <br><br>
          After that was a brief and very easy walk up to Mount Cook. Luckily we brought
          plenty of water or we would have been severely dehydrated and sunburnt <br>
          (Spoiler, we didn't).
          <br><br>
          When we finally arrived we saw a stupidly long line to a single burger joint
          which we unanimously dismissed as a silly place to visit.

            We woke up early and walked into town to meet up with other tourists and took a
            bus out to Arrowhead. <br>
            Quadbikes was the agenda and boy was it a blast. We rode through private land
            up and down rivers and raced across paddocks.
            The weather turned maybe 3 times so we ended up both wet, dusty and overheated
            all in one morning.
            <br><br>
            After getting back and a much needed shower we headed up the mountain to the
            famous Luge ride. It’s a neat little go kart track that uses the power of
            gravity and what looks unsafe speeds (But actually feels just fine).
            <br><br>
            That night after Dods snoring woke Sam, Wally and I up we snuck out to visit
            that burger joint.
            <br><br>
            Ferg Burger as we came to know it, is the tale of a man who ran his own little
            burger cart that became so well known to tourists (Who spread its name around
            the world) it became a must have.
            <br><br>
            If you’ve never been to NZ it is a must have. Food coma for days, loved it.
