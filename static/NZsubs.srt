I’m gonna pause mine

190
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,480
Hello, i’ll get out of the way

191
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,300
Now, we’ve got a criminal here with a mobile phone

192
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,300
Because of the microchip on my body

193
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,920
Against my free will, he had a mocking grin

194
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,620
Well, of course I always get that

195
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,220
Now you see, because of the microchip he knew I was coming here

196
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,680
(inaudible) Criminal with a mocking grin, 

197
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,340
Who has no right to have a lime scooter 

198
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,800
(Inaudible) You see this is what I mean about criminals,

199
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,100
That, torment their victims who have a microchip

On their body against their free will. He’s got a very nasty evil mocking grin

201
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,940
Now he’s not the first criminal, but the problem with microchips 

202
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:24,100

205
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,420
people could trip over. Now i’ve got to wait patiently for him to leave the park-
