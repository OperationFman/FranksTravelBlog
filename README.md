## Context 
This is my travel blog, hosted here: https://frankstravelblog.pythonanywhere.com/

I created it to show off images, videos and tell stories of my travels overseas, this also serves to demonstrate my basic web-design skills.

The home page contains a bio about me with a link to my (Now likely outdated) resume.

The site also supports Web and mobile screen sizes.



Accessing the menu on the left (or top on mobile) will show a list of locations i've been to from newest-oldest and a map.

The map link will open an interactive view of earth with icons containing images and details of places i've been.

The remaining content is info and images of my trips, the arrangement will depend on wether the user is viewing in mobile or desktop mode.

These videos are hosted on Google Drive to save on bandwidth (And thus deployment costs) and are 20-30 minutes edited works of my time overseas, usually with friends.
